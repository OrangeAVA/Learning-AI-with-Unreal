## About the Book
In the rapidly evolving world of game development, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into your Unreal Engine projects is no longer optional—it’s essential. Mastering AI for Unreal Engine is your definitive guide to unlocking the transformative power of AI, propelling your games beyond the ordinary and into the realm of cutting-edge, immersive experiences.

Through a step-by-step approach, you will explore a wide range of AI techniques, including pathfinding, behavior trees, perception systems, and the powerful Environment Query System (EQS). Each chapter delves into the theoretical underpinnings of these AI components, followed by hands-on exercises and real-world examples that demonstrate their integration within Unreal Engine. We will learn to create intelligent, dynamic, and engaging game experiences by leveraging the power of AI.

What sets this book apart is its deep dive into emerging AI frameworks like the Mass Framework, giving you a strategic edge in adopting the latest trends and technologies that are shaping the future of gaming. You’ll learn how to optimize your AI systems, enhance performance, and master debugging techniques critical for smooth, efficient development processes.

Mastering AI for Unreal Engine doesn’t just teach you AI—it empowers you to innovate, create intelligent game worlds, and stand out in the fiercely competitive game development landscape. 

## What you will learn
